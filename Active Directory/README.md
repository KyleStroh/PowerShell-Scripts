## PowerShell Scripts

These are some PowerShell Active Directory scripts I have made and have found useful.

```markdown

### Changes need for the scripts to be used.

All of the scripts in the function folder use csv files to make it easier/ speed up the process.

Where ever the code scripts says the words  `entername` or `local` or `fillinwithpassword`
 you need to supply your proper information in those spots.

```
All of these scripts were written on a VM environment running Microsoft Server 2012 R2
