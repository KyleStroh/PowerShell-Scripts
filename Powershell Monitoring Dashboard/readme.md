* Large shoutout to Stephen over at foxdeploy this is something I have been wanting to do
* I used his code of how PowerShell populates the html (kudos and making it very simple) you can find it [here](https://foxdeploy.com/2016/04/11/building-better-powershell-dashboards/)
* I will note Stephen's version is much simpler than mine due to the powerful Hyper-V Get-VM command he is able to use.
